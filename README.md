# Sentinel-Gun

	Web Camera will be used along with the gun holder to capture the images. 
	It acquires the live videos which should be then further analyzed for face detection and tracking.
	Precise coding is to be made for face detection and tracking algorithms.
	The captured video from the web camera is fed to spyder software where the coding should be compiled in OpenCV platform.
	It gives the output of face detection and tracking of the captured image sequences and it is then fed to Arduino microcontroller.
	In Arduino, the face tracking will be coupled with the servo motors which directly controls the Gun for tilting, rotation and triggering. 
	Thus, it could fire the enemies automatically when they come into the range of the camera. 
	This work will be useful for our country in Defense Sectors
